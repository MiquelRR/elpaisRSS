news app loader from RSS

This is a practice for experimenting with reciclerViews and data stored in sharedPreferences.

In addition I have used a source to having real news using public rss from the newspaper "El Pa√≠s", sot that the use of ReciclerViews makes sense, this topic force me to experiment coroutines, to load data from internet, although it was not the object of the practice.
